# rock-paper-scissors-TOPproject

In this project, I will be displaying my knowledge of the fundamentals of JavaScript. As of 3/24/22, the fundamentals involve the creation and use of variables, functions/methods, conceptualizing the problem from the perspective of a programmer (i.e., algorithmic thinking, problem compartmentalization, pseudocode, and more), the use of various data types, the use of boolean values and conditional statements, and more. 

Note that while the project may eventually use more complex fundamentals such as loops and some data structures, as of 3/24/22, those topics have not yet been discussed as part of the curriculum at TOP. Any early appearance of such concepts has been previously learned from other sources or researched from other sources during the creation of the project. 

As of 3/24/22, the game will take place entirely within the console of the browser. However, a GUI will eventually be put in place once the TOP curriculum reaches that point.
